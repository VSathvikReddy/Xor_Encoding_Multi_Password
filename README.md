Haha, just kidding!!!😉
Now, before you officially join the team, there's one final challenge ahead of you.
The links.txt file has the link but it's encoded, to help you guys, we have written a decoder but it's unfortunatly buggy due to our skill issue.😭

More specifically the "debug.cpp" has many errors even in the conceptual level, so please learn and fix those function.
⚠️Warning!!!If you touch anything else, you may never recover your entrance ticket.
So be careful, All the best, hoping to see you guys.


Once you're done debugging, open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then run the following commands:

g++ decoder.cpp helper.cpp debug.cpp


To execute:

On Windows: ./a.exe

On Linux/macOS: ./a.out

Finally, enter your roll number when prompted.

Best of luck, and see you on the other side! 🚀
- Programming Club Team
